    Stop thinking of Claude as something you give instructions to. Start thinking of it as a collaborator you share context with. This is the single most important shift in how you work with AI.

continue interviewing me continually until it's
complete, then write the detailed spec to the file.</div>
  </div>

  <CalloutBox type="limitation" title="Key Insight">
    The interview process is where the magic happens. Claude will ask you questions you hadn't considered, surface edge cases, and help you think through tradeoffs. This is why planning mode reduces iteration—you're solving problems before they exist.
  </CalloutBox>

  <CalloutBox type="breakthrough" title="Review Before Approving">
    Read the plan thoroughly before approving. If technical details are unclear, ask Claude to explain them in non-technical terms. It's much easier to change a plan than to rewrite implemented code.
